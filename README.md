# Arithmetic_Arranger
Program that takes as input a series of problems and prints the result. 

The purpose of this program is to get a series of problems (max 5) from the user and print the answer, when asked. The program will arrange the problems in same order as they are arranged by the elementry school students. All the code has been comented for better understanding. The code has been written using Python, and therefore I recommend to use an IDE that is comaptible with .py files.
